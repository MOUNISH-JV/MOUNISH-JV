    FOREIGN KEY (farm_id) REFERENCES Farms(farm_id)  -- Foreign key linking alert to farm
);

-- Step 13: Create a trigger to generate alerts for excessive water usage
-- This trigger automatically creates an alert if water consumption on a farm exceeds 100,000 liters in one usage
CREATE TRIGGER check_water_usage
AFTER INSERT ON WaterUsage
FOR EACH ROW
WHEN (NEW.water_consumed_liters > 100000)
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO Alerts (farm_id, alert_message)
    VALUES (NEW.farm_id, 'High water usage detected');
